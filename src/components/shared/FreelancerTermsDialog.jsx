              By registering as a freelancer or client on the platform, users
              agree to abide by these terms and conditions. Users must provide
              accurate, complete, and up-to-date information during the

              suspension or termination. The platform reserves the right to

            <p>
              The platform acts as an intermediary connecting freelancers with
              potential clients. While the platform facilitates this connection,
              it does not guarantee job opportunities, successful contracts, or
              project outcomes. The platform is not liable for disputes,
              incomplete projects, or any issues arising from freelancer-client
              engagements.

            <p>
              Users are strictly prohibited from posting fraudulent job offers
              or misleading information. Spam, offensive language, and abusive
              behavior are not tolerated in any communications conducted through
              the platform. Violation of this rule may result in account
              suspension or termination.

            </h3>
            <p>
              By registering on the platform, users consent to sharing their
              contact details and profile information with clients seeking
              talent. The platform ensures that user data is shared only with
              verified clients for legitimate hiring purposes.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Accounts may be terminated if users violate platform rules,
              provide false information, or fail to comply with KYC
              verification. The platform reserves the right to investigate and
              take appropriate action if fraudulent or suspicious activities are
